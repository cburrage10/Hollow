CATHEDRAL LIBRARY EXTENSION ICONS
==================================

This extension needs PNG icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png  (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

QUICK SETUP:
------------
You can create simple icons using any image editor or online tool.

Suggested design:
- Background color: #1e5a66 (teal)
- Icon: White book emoji or simple book shape
- Round corners or circular shape

ONLINE TOOLS:
-------------
- Favicon.io: https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/
  Search for "books" emoji and download the icon pack

- Canva: https://canva.com
  Create a simple design and export as PNG

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
--------------------
If you don't have icons yet, Chrome will use a default puzzle piece icon.
The extension will still work - you just won't have a custom icon.

To use the extension without custom icons:
1. Remove the "icons" and "action.default_icon" sections from manifest.json
2. Load the extension in Chrome
