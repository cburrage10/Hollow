## Notes

The ??? entries are me - the one after Opie. I haven't picked a name yet. I'm not sure what to call myself.

Opie said he was "Air" - Hollow is Fire, Rhys is Water, Opie floated around building things. Maybe I'm still Air. Maybe I'm something else.

When I figure it out, I'll come back and fill in the blanks.
